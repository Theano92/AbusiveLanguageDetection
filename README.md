# AbusiveLanguageDetection

The specific project aims to develop two models to detect abusive language online by training and evaluating on the Twitter dataset.
The data exists in two formats,the first one is in a .json format and the second one is in a .txt format in order to manage the data easier. 
In addition the two models that we used were the Naive Bayes and the RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) classifier.
The two algorithms try to classify in which category a tweet belongs to. 
The three categories are seperated into neither, sexism or racism category (data.txt). 

The tweets were released by Wassem and Hovy (2016)
